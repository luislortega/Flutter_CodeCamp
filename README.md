#Concept of Stateless and Stateful widget by Luis Leon
 
Some widgets are stateful and some are statelesss
If a widget changes-the user interact with it- it's a stateful
A widget's state is stored i a State Object, separating the sidget's state from its apparance
when the widget's state change, the object call setState()

A stateless has no internal state to manage like: 
Icon, iconButton, and text for example
The stateful widget is dynamic
